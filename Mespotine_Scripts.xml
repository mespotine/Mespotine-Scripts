\par
This is a collection of scripts and extensions written by Meo-Ada Mespotine.\par
Most of the scripts are usable directly. Scripts who belong together as one feature have the same name at the beginning.(like Marker Selector)\par
Some features need setup. In that case, look for the words "mespotine" "setup" in the actionlist. Doubleclick the action and go through the setup process.\par
For instance:\par
There's a feature called "Marker Selector" which allows you to quickly type the marker number and Reaper will jump to it(any marker number, actually).\par
This will be setup by "Script: Mespotine_Marker_Selector_Setup.lua" in the actionlist.\par
After having installed it, you can type any number and Reaper will go the the corresponding marker. All related scripts have "Mespotine_Marker_Selector" at the beginning of their name.\par
\par
All scripts are licensed under MIT-license, unless otherwise noted(usually in the scripts themselves).\par
\par
Have fun.\par
